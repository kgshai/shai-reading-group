# Deep MDP

## Resources
- https://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/gelada19a/gelada19a.pdf

## Notes
- A parameterized latent space model trained on two losses:
	- Prediction of rewards
	- prediction of next latent states
- Essentially represents an alternative MDP where states are our representations (hence bisimulation)

Let $(\sc S, \sc A, r, \sc T)$ be an MDP
