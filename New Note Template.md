# Summary
**Written by the presenter prior to the presentation.** Give a high-level overview of the topics discussed in this note, including:
- A brief description of the context behind this note
- A bulleted list outlining the main topics discussed in the note and defining relevant terms
- A discussion of key takeaways, including an explanation of why we care, and some example areas of application of these ideas
# Introduction
**Written by the scribe during (and perhaps after) the presentation.** Introduce the topic being discussed to an audience that hasn't encountered this topic before.
- Ensure that each piece of the topic is properly motivated. (For example, if you're introducing MLPs, and they include nonlinearities, why are the nonlinearities there?) Make this section as long as necessary to properly motivate the foundational ideas behind this topic.
- Avoid getting into the weeds! If you make a statement that requires a mathematical proof, put that in the [[New Note Template#Analysis|analysis]] section. If there's more than a couple lines of math, but it in the [[New Note Template#Exposition|exposition]] section. Use intra-note links to connect your propositions (in the introduction and exposition) to their proofs (in the analysis).
- Separate content using level-4 headers (e.g. "\#\#\#\# Title of section") in ways that make sense conceptually.

# Analysis
**Written by the presenter prior to the presentation, refined by scribe after presentation. Depth is very optional, this section will mainly be useful for the presenter while learning about the details of their topic.** Present any mathematical derivations, technical details, or documentation that is too verbose to be worth including in the introduction section. Use this section to keep the note technically complete without overcomplicating the introduction. Examples of content that would go in the analysis section:
- Mathematical derivations of propositions presented in the introduction, where the derivation *doesn't shed any light* on the meaning or use cases of the proposition
- Diagrams showing details of system architecture that are important for a working solution, but not conceptually central
- Expositions that relate the content of the introduction to more advanced concepts, which are only fully explored in other notes
- Additional information about the concept which are relevant in downstream concepts
Examples of content that should not go in the analysis section, and rather, should be kept in the introduction:
- Simple mathematical derivations that illuminate a core concept, e.g. the derivation of a proposition that follows in a straightforward way from Bayes' Rule. These should be kept in the introduction section to ensure that readers understand intuitively why the proposition follows from Bayes' Rule.
- Diagrams showing components of system architecture that are very relevant to understanding a core concept. These should be kept in the introduction to give readers a visual understanding of the core concept as they first encounter it.
