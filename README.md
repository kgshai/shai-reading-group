# Welcome
Welcome to the ML@B Research vault! This is a folder of markdown files (see [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)) meant to be a central repository for ML@B research knowledge. It will be organized as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault, so be sure to download Obsidian if you wish to use it. This folder will be shared with all ML@B members and updated via `git`. It is intended to serve as
1. A structured, piece-by-piece educational resource for ML@B members unfamiliar with many areas of ML
2. An unstructured venue for tinkering with new ideas
3. A tool for transforming unstructured exploration into structured, absorbable knowledge
As more is decided regarding the structure of our notes, we will add to this note explaining the organization of the vault, and giving instructions to new members about how to get involved.
