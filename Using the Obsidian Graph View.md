## Try filtering for parts of the graph you're interested in
1. Open the "Filters" drop down list to the top left of the graph viewer and click on the search bar 
2. Try filtering for the files in the base folder "Linear Algebra" using the "path:" option 
	![[Images/README/filterfile.png | 400]]
3. Try adding a tag (as \#\<tag name\>, e.g. #read) to a few articles and filter down to these articles using the "tag:" option 
	![[Images/README/readtags.png | 400]] ![[Images/README/filtertag.png | 400]]
4. Try filtering for articles either in "Linear Algebra" OR tagged with #read by concatenating the relevant "file:" and "tag:" searches with the "OR" boolean operator. Equivalently, use the "AND" boolean operator to filter articles tagged #read within "Linear Algebra". ![[Images/README/filteror.png | 400]]
## Try grouping the graph
1. Open the "Groups" drop down list to the top left of the graph viewer, press “new group,” and explore the possible criteria 
	![[Images/README/groups.png | 200]]
2. Try creating a group for each base folder in the `reading-group` repo using the "path:" option 
	![[Images/README/groupfile.png | 400]]
3. Try adding a tag (as \#\<tag name\>, e.g. #read) to a few articles and visualizing this group of articles with the "tag:" option 
	![[Images/README/readtags.png | 400]] ![[Images/README/grouptag.png | 400]]
4. Try creating a group of articles either in "Linear Algebra" OR tagged with #read by concatenating the relevant "file:" and "tag:" searches with the "OR" boolean operator. Equivalently, use the "AND" boolean operator to group articles tagged #read within "Linear Algebra" ![[Images/README/groupor.png | 400]]
